VERY EASY


In this stage, you'll create a TCP server that listens on port 4221.

TCP is the underlying protocol used by HTTP servers.

Tests
The tester will execute your program like this:

$ ./your_program.sh
Then, the tester will try to connect to your server on port 4221. The connection must succeed for you to pass this stage.


Code Examples--------
Just do server.listen in the end.
