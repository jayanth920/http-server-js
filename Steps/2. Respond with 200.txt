VERY EASY
In this stage, your server will respond to an HTTP request with a 200 response.

HTTP response
An HTTP response is made up of three parts, each separated by a CRLF (\r\n):

Status line.
Zero or more headers, each ending with a CRLF.
Optional response body.
In this stage, your server's response will only contain a status line. Here's the response your server must send:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n\r\n
Here's a breakdown of the response:

// Status line
HTTP/1.1  // HTTP version
200       // Status code
OK        // Optional reason phrase
\r\n      // CRLF that marks the end of the status line

// Headers (empty)
\r\n      // CRLF that marks the end of the headers

// Response body (empty)
Tests
The tester will execute your program like this:

$ ./your_program.sh
The tester will then send an HTTP GET request to your server:

$ curl -v http://localhost:4221
Your server must respond to the request with the following response:

HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n\r\n
Notes
You can ignore the contents of the request. We'll cover parsing requests in later stages.
For more information about HTTP responses, see the MDN Web Docs on HTTP responses or the HTTP/1.1 specification.
This challenge uses HTTP/1.1.

------CODE HELP

const net = require("net");
// You can use print statements as follows for debugging, they'll be visible when running tests.
console.log("Logs from your program will appear here!");
// Uncomment this to pass the first stage
const server = net.createServer((socket) => {
  socket.write("HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n\r\n");
  socket.on("close", () => {
    socket.end();
  });
});
server.listen(4221, "localhost");
